	<h1>Grievance Cell</h1>
	<p>
	<h3>A grievance is a formal complaint that is raised by an employee towards an employer within the workplace.<br> There are many reasons as to why a grievance can be raised, and also many ways to go about dealing with such a scenario. Reasons for filing a grievance in the workplace can be as a result of, but not limited to, a breach of the terms and conditions of an employment contract, raises and promotions, or lack thereof, as well as harassment and employment discrimination.</h3></p>
	<p>
	<h3>In order to maintain safety and security to the girls and women, a cell has been constituted for redressal of grievances. Our women grievance cell stays alert all the time to prevent any sexual abuse towards the students and female workers. If the women face any harassment from any area or public place, then they can complain at our women grievance cell. The members will look into the issues, gather the evidence, and take the necessary action against the guilty.<br> We also focus on preventing this kind of harassment by using secret monitory services, which keep a keen eye on the entire area.</h3></p><br><br><br><br><br>
