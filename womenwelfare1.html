<p ><center> <h2>What are women Welfare Orginizations </h3></center></p>
  <label class="p1"><center>The statistics are always scary when it comes to the number of instances of sexual or physical violence against women in India at any given hour, day or year. There are several organisations that work towards helping women combat this constant threat of violence, and work towards making our country safer for women by initiating policy level changes and conducting awareness campaigns that aim to educate the public. Such organisations usually cover one or more of the following objectives.

    Rescue women and children from unsafe or violent environments and rehabilitate them at a safe temporary or permanent shelter.
    Provide vulnerable women with financial support or vocational training and help them become financially and socially self-reliant.
    Provide legal advice to help victims of sexual or physical violence understand her rights and initiate the judicial process to attain justice.
    Provide counselling and psychological rehabilitation.

But when a woman is in a difficult mental space, it is difficult for her to sieve through the hundreds of organisations and their contact details and reach out to the right one. Here I have attempted to make a one-stop resource page, which can serve as a directory for vulnerable women.</center></label>
